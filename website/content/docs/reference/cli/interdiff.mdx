title: jj interdiff
isCommand: true
---

Compare the changes of two commits

This excludes changes from other commits by temporarily rebasing `--from` onto `--to`'s parents. If you wish to compare the same change across versions, consider `jj evolog -p` instead.

```shell title="Usage"
jj interdiff [OPTIONS] <--from <REVSET>|--to <REVSET>> [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Restrict the diff to these paths

### Options

- `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Show changes from this revision
- `-t`, `--to <REVSET>` — Show changes to this revision
- `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
- `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
- `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

  The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
- `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

  Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
- `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
- `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
- `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

  A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
- `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
- `-w`, `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
- `-b`, `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines
