Split a revision in two

Starts a [diff editor] on the changes in the revision. Edit the right side of the diff until it has the content you want in the new revision. Once you close the editor, your edited content will replace the previous revision. The remaining changes will be put in a new revision on top.

[diff editor]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/#editing-diffs

If the change you split had a description, you will be asked to enter a change description for each commit. If the change did not have a description, the remaining changes will not get a description, and you will be asked for a description only for the selected changes.

Splitting an empty commit is not supported because the same effect can be achieved with `jj new`.

```shell title="Usage"
jj split [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Files matching any of these filesets are put in the selected changes

### Options

- `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which parts to split

  This is the default if no filesets are provided.
- `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
- `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` — The revision to split

  Default value: `@`
- `-d`, `--destination <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to base the new revision onto (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
- `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — The revision(s) to insert after (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
- `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — The revision(s) to insert before (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
- `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use (don't open editor)

  The description is used for the commit with the selected changes. The source commit description is kept unchanged.
- `-p`, `--parallel` — Split the revision into two parallel revisions instead of a parent and child
