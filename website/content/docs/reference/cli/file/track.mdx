title: jj file track
isCommand: true
---

Start tracking specified paths in the working copy

Without arguments, all paths that are not ignored will be tracked.

By default, new files in the working copy are automatically tracked, so this command has no effect. You can configure which paths to automatically track by setting `snapshot.auto-track` (e.g. to `"none()"` or `"glob:**/*.rs"`). Files that don't match the pattern can be manually tracked using this command. The default pattern is `all()`.

```shell title="Usage"
jj file track <FILESETS>...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` â€” Paths to track
