isCommand: true

Move the working-copy commit to the child revision

The command creates a new empty working copy revision that is the child of a
descendant `offset` revisions ahead of the parent of the current working
copy.

For example, when the offset is 1:

```text
D        D @
|        |/
C @  =>  C
|/       |
B        B
```

If `--edit` is passed, the working copy revision is changed to the child of
the current working copy revision.

```text
D        D
|        |
C        C
|        |
B   =>   @
|        |
@        A
```

```shell title="Usage"
jj next [OPTIONS] [OFFSET]
```

### Arguments

- `<OFFSET>` — How many revisions to move forward. Advances to the next child by default

  Default value: `1`

### Options

- `-e`, `--edit` — Instead of creating a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit (like `jj new`), edit the target commit directly (like `jj edit`)

  Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = false`
- `-n`, `--no-edit` — The inverse of `--edit`

  Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = true`
- `--conflict` — Jump to the next conflicted descendant
