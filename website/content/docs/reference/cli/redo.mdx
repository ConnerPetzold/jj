Redo the most recently undone operation

This is the natural counterpart of `jj undo`. Repeated invocations of `jj undo` and `jj redo` act similarly to Undo/Redo commands in a text editor.

Use `jj op log` to visualize the log of past operations, including a detailed description of any past undo/redo operations. See also `jj op restore` to explicitly restore an older operation by its id (available in the operation log).

```shell title="Usage"
jj redo
```
