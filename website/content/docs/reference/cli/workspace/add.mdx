Add a workspace

By default, the new workspace inherits the sparse patterns of the current workspace. You can override this with the `--sparse-patterns` option.

```shell title="Usage"
jj workspace add [OPTIONS] <DESTINATION>
```

### Arguments

- `<DESTINATION>` — Where to create the new workspace

### Options

- `--name <NAME>` — A name for the workspace

  To override the default, which is the basename of the destination directory.
- `-r`, `--revision <REVSETS>` — A list of parent revisions for the working-copy commit of the newly created workspace. You may specify nothing, or any number of parents.

  If no revisions are specified, the new workspace will be created, and its working-copy commit will exist on top of the parent(s) of the working-copy commit in the current workspace, i.e. they will share the same parent(s).

  If any revisions are specified, the new workspace will be created, and the new working-copy commit will be created with all these revisions as parents, i.e. the working-copy commit will exist as if you had run `jj new r1 r2 r3 ...`.
- `--sparse-patterns <SPARSE_PATTERNS>` — How to handle sparse patterns when creating a new workspace

  Default value: `copy`

  Possible values:

  - `copy`:
    Copy all sparse patterns from the current workspace
  - `full`:
    Include all files in the new workspace
  - `empty`:
    Clear all files from the workspace (it will be empty)
