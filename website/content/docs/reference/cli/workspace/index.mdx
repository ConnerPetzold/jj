Commands for working with workspaces

Workspaces let you add additional working copies attached to the same repo. A common use case is so you can run a slow build or test in one workspace while you're continuing to write code in another workspace.

Each workspace has its own working-copy commit. When you have more than one workspace attached to a repo, they are indicated by `<workspace name>@` in `jj log`.

Each workspace also has own sparse patterns.

```shell title="Usage"
jj workspace <COMMAND>
```
