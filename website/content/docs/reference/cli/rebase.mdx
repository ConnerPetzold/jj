Move revisions to different parent(s)

This command moves revisions to different parent(s) while preserving the
changes (diff) in the revisions.

There are three different ways of specifying which revisions to rebase:

* `--source/-s` to rebase a revision and its descendants
* `--branch/-b` to rebase a whole branch, relative to the destination
* `--revisions/-r` to rebase the specified revisions without their
  descendants

If no option is specified, it defaults to `-b @`.

There are three different ways of specifying where the revisions should be
rebased to:

* `--destination/-d` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets
* `--insert-after/-A` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets and
  to rebase the targets' descendants onto the rebased revisions
* `--insert-before/-B` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets'
  parents and to rebase the targets and their descendants onto the rebased
  revisions

See the sections below for details about the different ways of specifying
which revisions to rebase where.

If a working-copy revision gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty
revision. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

### Specifying which revisions to rebase

With `--source/-s`, the command rebases the specified revision and its
descendants to the destination. For example, `jj rebase -s M -d O` would
transform your history like this (letters followed by an apostrophe are
post-rebase versions):

```text
O           N'
|           |
| N         M'
| |         |
| M         O
| |    =>   |
| | L       | L
| |/        | |
| K         | K
|/          |/
J           J
```

Each revision passed to `-s` will become a direct child of the destination,
so if you instead run `jj rebase -s M -s N -d O` (or `jj rebase -s 'M|N' -d
O`) in the example above, then N' would instead be a direct child of O.

With `--branch/-b`, the command rebases the whole "branch" containing the
specified revision. A "branch" is the set of revisions that includes:

* the specified revision and ancestors that are not also ancestors of the
  destination
* all descendants of those revisions

In other words, `jj rebase -b X -d Y` rebases revisions in the revset
`(Y..X)::` (which is equivalent to `jj rebase -s 'roots(Y..X)' -d Y` for a
single root). For example, either `jj rebase -b L -d O` or `jj rebase -b M
-d O` would transform your history like this (because `L` and `M` are on the
same "branch", relative to the destination):

```text
O           N'
|           |
| N         M'
| |         |
| M         | L'
| |    =>   |/
| | L       K'
| |/        |
| K         O
|/          |
J           J
```

With `--revisions/-r`, the command rebases only the specified revisions to
the destination. Any "hole" left behind will be filled by rebasing
descendants onto the specified revisions' parent(s). For example,
`jj rebase -r K -d M` would transform your history like this:

```text
M          K'
|          |
| L        M
| |   =>   |
| K        | L'
|/         |/
J          J
```

Multiple revisions can be specified, and any dependencies (graph edges)
within the set will be preserved. For example, `jj rebase -r 'K|N' -d O`
would transform your history like this:

```text
O           N'
|           |
| N         K'
| |         |
| M         O
| |    =>   |
| | L       | M'
| |/        |/
| K         | L'
|/          |/
J           J
```

`jj rebase -s X` is similar to `jj rebase -r X::` and will behave the same
if X is a single revision. However, if X is a set of multiple revisions,
or if you passed multiple `-s` arguments, then `jj rebase -s` will make each
of the specified revisions an immediate child of the destination, while
`jj rebase -r` will preserve dependencies within the set.

Note that you can create a merge revision by repeating the `-d` argument.
For example, if you realize that revision L actually depends on revision M
in order to work (in addition to its current parent K), you can run `jj
rebase -s L -d K -d M`:

```text
M          L'
|          |\
| L        M |
| |   =>   | |
| K        | K
|/         |/
J          J
```

### Specifying where to rebase the revisions

With `--destination/-d`, the command rebases the selected revisions onto
the targets. Existing descendants of the targets will not be affected. See
the section above for examples.

With `--insert-after/-A`, the selected revisions will be inserted after the
targets. This is similar to `-d`, but if the targets have any existing
descendants, then those will be rebased onto the rebased selected revisions.

For example, `jj rebase -r K -A L` will rewrite history like this:
```text
N           N'
|           |
| M         | M'
|/          |/
L      =>   K'
|           |
| K         L
|/          |
J           J
```

The `-A` (and `-B`) argument can also be used for reordering revisions. For
example, `jj rebase -r M -A J` will rewrite history like this:
```text
M          L'
|          |
L          K'
|     =>   |
K          M'
|          |
J          J
```

With `--insert-before/-B`, the selected revisions will be inserted before
the targets. This is achieved by rebasing the selected revisions onto the
target revisions' parents, and then rebasing the target revisions and their
descendants onto the rebased revisions.

For example, `jj rebase -r K -B L` will rewrite history like this:
```text
N           N'
|           |
| M         | M'
|/          |/
L     =>    L'
|           |
| K         K'
|/          |
J           J
```

The `-A` and `-B` arguments can also be combined, which can be useful around
merges. For example, you can use `jj rebase -r K -A J -B M` to create a new
merge (but `jj rebase -r M -d L -d K` might be simpler in this particular
case):
```text
M           M'
|           |\
L           L |
|     =>    | |
| K         | K'
|/          |/
J           J
```

To insert a commit inside an existing merge with `jj rebase -r O -A K -B M`:
```text
O           N'
|           |\
N           | M'
|\          | |\
| M         | O'|
| |    =>   |/ /
| L         | L
| |         | |
K |         K |
|/          |/
J           J
```

```shell title="Usage"
jj rebase [OPTIONS] <--destination <REVSETS>|--insert-after <REVSETS>|--insert-before <REVSETS>>
```

### Options

- `-b`, `--branch <REVSETS>` — Rebase the whole branch relative to destination's ancestors (can be repeated)

  `jj rebase -b=br -d=dst` is equivalent to `jj rebase '-s=roots(dst..br)' -d=dst`.

  If none of `-b`, `-s`, or `-r` is provided, then the default is `-b @`.
- `-s`, `--source <REVSETS>` — Rebase specified revision(s) together with their trees of descendants (can be repeated)

  Each specified revision will become a direct child of the destination revision(s), even if some of the source revisions are descendants of others.

  If none of `-b`, `-s`, or `-r` is provided, then the default is `-b @`.
- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Rebase the given revisions, rebasing descendants onto this revision's parent(s)

  Unlike `-s` or `-b`, you may `jj rebase -r` a revision `A` onto a descendant of `A`.

  If none of `-b`, `-s`, or `-r` is provided, then the default is `-b @`.
- `-d`, `--destination <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to rebase onto (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
- `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — The revision(s) to insert after (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
- `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — The revision(s) to insert before (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
- `--skip-emptied` — If true, when rebasing would produce an empty commit, the commit is abandoned. It will not be abandoned if it was already empty before the rebase. Will never skip merge commits with multiple non-empty parents
- `--keep-divergent` — Keep divergent commits while rebasing

  Without this flag, divergent commits are abandoned while rebasing if another commit with the same change ID is already present in the destination with identical changes.
