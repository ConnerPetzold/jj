Abandon operation history

To discard old operation history, use `jj op abandon ..<operation ID>`. It will abandon the specified operation and all its ancestors. The descendants will be reparented onto the root operation.

To discard recent operations, use `jj op restore <operation ID>` followed by `jj op abandon <operation ID>..@-`.

Previous versions of a change (or predecessors) are also discarded if they become unreachable from the operation history. The abandoned operations, commits, and other unreachable objects can later be garbage collected by using `jj util gc` command.

```shell title="Usage"
