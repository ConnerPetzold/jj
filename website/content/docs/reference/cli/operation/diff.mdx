Compare changes to the repository between two operations

```shell title="Usage"
jj operation diff [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--operation <OPERATION>` [alias: `op`] — Show repository changes in this operation, compared to its parent
- `-f`, `--from <FROM>` — Show repository changes from this operation
- `-t`, `--to <TO>` — Show repository changes to this operation
- `--no-graph` — Don't show the graph, show a flat list of modified changes
- `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch of modifications to changes

  If the previous version has different parents, it will be temporarily rebased to the parents of the new version, so the diff is not contaminated by unrelated changes.
- `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
- `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
- `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

  The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
- `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

  Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
- `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
- `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
- `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

  A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
- `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
- `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
- `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines
