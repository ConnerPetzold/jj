title: jj operation restore
isCommand: true

Create a new operation that restores the repo to an earlier state

This restores the repo to the state at the specified operation, effectively undoing all later operations. It does so by creating a new operation.

```shell title="Usage"
jj operation restore [OPTIONS] <OPERATION>
```

### Arguments

- `<OPERATION>` — The operation to restore to

  Use `jj op log` to find an operation to restore to. Use e.g. `jj --at-op=<operation ID> log` before restoring to an operation to see the state of the repo at that operation.

### Options

- `--what <WHAT>` — What portions of the local state to restore (can be repeated)

  This option is EXPERIMENTAL.

  Default values: `repo`, `remote-tracking`

  Possible values:

  - `repo`:
    The jj repo state and local bookmarks
  - `remote-tracking`:
    The remote-tracking bookmarks. Do not restore these if you'd like to push after the undo
