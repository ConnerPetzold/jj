Abandon a revision

Abandon a revision, rebasing descendants onto its parent(s). The behavior is similar to `jj restore --changes-in`; the difference is that `jj abandon` gives you a new change, while `jj restore` updates the existing change.

If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

```shell title="Usage"
jj abandon [OPTIONS] [REVSETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to abandon (default: @)

### Options

- `--retain-bookmarks` — Do not delete bookmarks pointing to the revisions to abandon

  Bookmarks will be moved to the parent revisions instead.
- `--restore-descendants` — Do not modify the content of the children of the abandoned commits
