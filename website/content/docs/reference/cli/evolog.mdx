Show how a change has evolved over time

Lists the previous commits which a change has pointed to. The current commit of a change evolves when the change is updated, rebased, etc.

```shell title="Usage"
jj evolog [OPTIONS]
```

**Command Alias:** `evolution-log`

### Options

- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Follow changes from these revisions

  Default value: `@`
- `-n`, `--limit <LIMIT>` — Limit number of revisions to show

  Applied after revisions are reordered topologically, but before being reversed.
- `--reversed` — Show revisions in the opposite order (older revisions first)
- `--no-graph` — Don't show the graph, show a flat list of revisions
- `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each revision using the given template

  All 0-argument methods of the [`CommitEvolutionEntry` type] are available as keywords in the template expression. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

  If not specified, this defaults to the `templates.evolog` setting.

  [`CommitEvolutionEntry` type]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#commitevolutionentry-type

  [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
- `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch compared to the previous version of this change

  If the previous version has different parents, it will be temporarily rebased to the parents of the new version, so the diff is not contaminated by unrelated changes.
- `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
- `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
- `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

  The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
- `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

  Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
- `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
- `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
- `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

  A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
- `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
- `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
- `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines
