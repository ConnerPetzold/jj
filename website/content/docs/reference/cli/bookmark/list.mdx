List bookmarks and their targets

By default, a tracking remote bookmark will be included only if its target is different from the local target. A non-tracking remote bookmark won't be listed. For a conflicted bookmark (both local and remote), old target revisions are preceded by a "-" and new target revisions are preceded by a "+".

See [`jj help -k bookmarks`] for more information.

[`jj help -k bookmarks`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks

```shell title="Usage"
jj bookmark list [OPTIONS] [NAMES]...
```

**Command Alias:** `l`

### Arguments

- `<NAMES>` — Show bookmarks whose local name matches

  By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

  [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns

### Options

- `-a`, `--all-remotes` — Show all tracking and non-tracking remote bookmarks including the ones whose targets are synchronized with the local bookmarks
- `--remote <REMOTE>` — Show all tracking and non-tracking remote bookmarks belonging to this remote

  Can be combined with `--tracked` or `--conflicted` to filter the bookmarks shown (can be repeated.)

  By default, the specified remote name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select remotes by [wildcard pattern].

  [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns
- `-t`, `--tracked` — Show remote tracked bookmarks only. Omits local Git-tracking bookmarks by default
- `-c`, `--conflicted` — Show conflicted bookmarks only
- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Show bookmarks whose local targets are in the given revisions

  Note that `-r deleted_bookmark` will not work since `deleted_bookmark` wouldn't have a local target.
- `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each bookmark using the given template

  All 0-argument methods of the [`CommitRef` type] are available as keywords in the template expression. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

  [`CommitRef` type]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#commitref-type

  [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
- `--sort <SORT_KEY>` — Sort bookmarks based on the given key (or multiple keys)

  Suffix the key with `-` to sort in descending order of the value (e.g. `--sort name-`). Note that when using multiple keys, the first key is the most significant.

  This defaults to the `ui.bookmark-list-sort-keys` setting.

  Possible values: `name`, `name-`, `author-name`, `author-name-`, `author-email`, `author-email-`, `author-date`, `author-date-`, `committer-name`, `committer-name-`, `committer-email`, `committer-email-`, `committer-date`, `committer-date-`
