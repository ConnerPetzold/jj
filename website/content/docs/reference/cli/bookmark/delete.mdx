title: jj bookmark delete
isCommand: true
---

Delete an existing bookmark and propagate the deletion to remotes on the next push

Revisions referred to by the deleted bookmarks are not abandoned. To delete revisions as well as bookmarks, use `jj abandon`. For example, `jj abandon main..<bookmark>` will abandon revisions belonging to the `<bookmark>` branch (relative to the `main` branch.)

If you don't want the deletion of the local bookmark to propagate to any tracked remote bookmarks, use `jj bookmark forget` instead.

```shell title="Usage"
jj bookmark delete <NAMES>...
```

**Command Alias:** `d`

### Arguments

- `<NAMES>` â€” The bookmarks to delete

  By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].
