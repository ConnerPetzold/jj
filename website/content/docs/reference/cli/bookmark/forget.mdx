Forget a bookmark without marking it as a deletion to be pushed

If a local bookmark is forgotten, any corresponding remote bookmarks will become untracked to ensure that the forgotten bookmark will not impact remotes on future pushes.

```shell title="Usage"
jj bookmark forget [OPTIONS] <NAMES>...
```

**Command Alias:** `f`

### Arguments

- `<NAMES>` — The bookmarks to forget

  By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

### Options

- `--include-remotes` — When forgetting a local bookmark, also forget any corresponding remote bookmarks

  A forgotten remote bookmark will not impact remotes on future pushes. It will be recreated on future fetches if it still exists on the remote. If there is a corresponding Git-tracking remote bookmark, it will also be forgotten.
