Stop tracking given remote bookmarks

A non-tracking remote bookmark is just a pointer to the last-fetched remote bookmark. It won't be imported as a local bookmark on future pulls.

If you want to forget a local bookmark while also untracking the corresponding remote bookmarks, use `jj bookmark forget` instead.

```shell title="Usage"
jj bookmark untrack <BOOKMARK@REMOTE>...
```

### Arguments

- `<BOOKMARK@REMOTE>` â€” Remote bookmarks to untrack

  By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

  Examples: bookmark@remote, glob:main@*, glob:jjfan-*@upstream
