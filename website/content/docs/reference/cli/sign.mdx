Cryptographically sign a revision

This command requires configuring a [commit signing] backend.

[commit signing]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/#commit-signing

```shell title="Usage"
jj sign [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — What revision(s) to sign

  If no revisions are specified, this defaults to the `revsets.sign` setting.

  Note that revisions are always re-signed.

  While that leads to discomfort for users, which sign with hardware devices, as of now we cannot reliably check if a commit is already signed by the user without creating a signature (see [#5786]).

- `--key <KEY>` — The key used for signing
