title: jj diff
isCommand: true

Compare file contents between two revisions

With the `-r` option, shows the changes compared to the parent revision. If there are several parent revisions (i.e., the given revision is a merge), then they will be merged and the changes from the result to the given revision will be shown.

With the `--from` and/or `--to` options, shows the difference from/to the given revisions. If either is left out, it defaults to the working-copy commit. For example, `jj diff --from main` shows the changes from "main" (perhaps a bookmark name) to the working-copy commit.

If no option is specified, it defaults to `-r @`.

```shell title="Usage"
jj diff [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Restrict the diff to these paths

### Options

- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Show changes in these revisions

  If there are multiple revisions, then the total diff for all of them will be shown. For example, if you have a linear chain of revisions A..D, then `jj diff -r B::D` equals `jj diff --from A --to D`. Multiple heads and/or roots are supported, but gaps in the revset are not supported (e.g. `jj diff -r 'A|C'` in a linear chain A..C).

  If a revision is a merge commit, this shows changes *from* the automatic merge of the contents of all of its parents *to* the contents of the revision itself.

  If none of `-r`, `-f`, or `-t` is provided, then the default is `-r @`.
- `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Show changes from this revision

  If none of `-r`, `-f`, or `-t` is provided, then the default is `-r @`.
- `-t`, `--to <REVSET>` — Show changes to this revision

  If none of `-r`, `-f`, or `-t` is provided, then the default is `-r @`.
- `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each file diff entry using the given template

  All 0-argument methods of the [`TreeDiffEntry` type] are available as keywords in the template expression. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

- `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
- `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
- `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

  The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
- `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

  Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
- `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
- `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
- `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

  A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
- `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
- `-w`, `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
- `-b`, `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines
