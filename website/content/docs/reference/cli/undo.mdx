title: jj undo
isCommand: true
---

Undo the last operation

If used once after a normal (non-`undo`) operation, this will undo that last operation by restoring its parent. If `jj undo` is used repeatedly, it will restore increasingly older operations, going further back into the past.

There is also a complementary `jj redo` command that would instead move in the direction of the future after one or more `jj undo`s.

Use `jj op log` to visualize the log of past operations, including a detailed description of any past undo/redo operations. See also `jj op restore` to explicitly restore an older operation by its id (available in the operation log).

```shell title="Usage"
jj undo [OPERATION]
```

### Arguments

- `<OPERATION>` â€” (deprecated, use `jj op revert <operation>`)

  The operation to undo

  Use `jj op log` to find an operation to undo.

  Default value: `@`
