Show revision history

Renders a graphical view of the project's history, ordered with children before parents. By default, the output only includes mutable revisions, along with some additional revisions for context. Use `jj log -r ::` to see all revisions. See [`jj help -k revsets`] for information about the syntax.

[`jj help -k revsets`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/

Spans of revisions that are not included in the graph per `--revisions` are rendered as a synthetic node labeled "(elided revisions)".

The working-copy commit is indicated by a `@` symbol in the graph. [Immutable revisions] have a `◆` symbol. Other commits have a `○` symbol. All of these symbols can be [customized].

```shell title="Usage"
jj log [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Show revisions modifying the given paths

### Options

- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Which revisions to show

  If no paths nor revisions are specified, this defaults to the `revsets.log` setting.
- `-n`, `--limit <LIMIT>` — Limit number of revisions to show

  Applied after revisions are filtered and reordered topologically, but before being reversed.
- `--reversed` — Show revisions in the opposite order (older revisions first)
- `--no-graph` — Don't show the graph, show a flat list of revisions
- `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each revision using the given template

  Run `jj log -T` to list the built-in templates.

  You can also specify arbitrary template expressions using the [built-in keywords]. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

  If not specified, this defaults to the `templates.log` setting.

  [built-in keywords]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#commit-keywords

  [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
- `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch
- `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
- `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
- `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

  The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
- `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

  Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
- `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
- `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
- `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

  A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
- `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
- `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
- `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines
