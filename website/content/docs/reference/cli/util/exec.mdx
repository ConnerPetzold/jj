title: jj util exec
isCommand: true
---

Execute an external command via jj

This is useful for arbitrary aliases.

!! WARNING !!

The following technique just provides a convenient syntax for running
arbitrary code on your system. Using it irresponsibly may cause damage
ranging from breaking the behavior of `jj undo` to wiping your file system.
Exercise the same amount of caution while writing these aliases as you would
when typing commands into the terminal!

This feature may be removed or replaced by an embedded scripting language in
the future.

Let's assume you have a script called "my-jj-script" in you $PATH and you
would like to execute it as "jj my-script". You would add the following line
to your configuration file to achieve that:

```toml
[aliases]
my-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "my-jj-script"]
#                            ^^^^
# This makes sure that flags are passed to your script instead of parsed by jj.
```

If you don't want to manage your script as a separate file, you can even
inline it into your config file:

```toml
[aliases]
my-inline-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "bash", "-c", """
set -euo pipefail
echo "Look Ma, everything in one file!"
echo "args: $@"
""", ""]
#    ^^
# This last empty string will become "$0" in bash, so your actual arguments
# are all included in "$@" and start at "$1" as expected.
```

> Note: Shebangs (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env`) aren't necessary since you're
> already explicitly passing your script into the right shell.

```shell title="Usage"
jj util exec <COMMAND> [ARGS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<COMMAND>` — External command to execute
- `<ARGS>` — Arguments to pass to the external command
