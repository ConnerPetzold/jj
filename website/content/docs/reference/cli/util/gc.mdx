title: jj util gc
isCommand: true
---

Run backend-dependent garbage collection.

To garbage-collect old operations and the commits/objects referenced by them, run `jj op abandon ..<some old operation>` before `jj util gc`.

```shell title="Usage"
jj util gc [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--expire <EXPIRE>` â€” Time threshold

  By default, only obsolete objects and operations older than 2 weeks are pruned.

  Only the string "now" can be passed to this parameter. Support for arbitrary absolute and relative timestamps will come in a subsequent release.
