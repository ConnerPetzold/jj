title: jj commit
isCommand: true
---

Update the description and create a new change on top [default alias: ci]

This command is very similar to `jj split`. Differences include:

* `jj commit` is not interactive by default (it selects all changes).

* `jj commit` doesn't have a `-r` option. It always acts on the working-copy commit (@).

* `jj split` (without `-d/-A/-B`) will move bookmarks forward from the old change to the child change. `jj commit` doesn't move bookmarks forward.

* `jj split` allows you to move the selected changes to a different destination with `-d/-A/-B`.

```shell title="Usage"
jj commit [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Put these paths in the first commit

### Options

- `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which changes to include in the first commit
- `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
- `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use (don't open editor)
- `--reset-author` — Reset the author to the configured user

  This resets the author name, email, and timestamp.

  You can use it in combination with the JJ_USER and JJ_EMAIL environment variables to set a different author:

  $ JJ_USER='Foo Bar' JJ_EMAIL=foo@bar.com jj commit --reset-author
- `--author <AUTHOR>` — Set author to the provided string

  This changes author name and email while retaining author timestamp for non-discardable commits.
