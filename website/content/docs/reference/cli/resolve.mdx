Resolve conflicted files with an external merge tool

Only conflicts that can be resolved with a 3-way merge are supported. See docs for merge tool configuration instructions. External merge tools will be invoked for each conflicted file one-by-one until all conflicts are resolved. To stop resolving conflicts, exit the merge tool without making any changes.

Note that conflicts can also be resolved without using this command. You may edit the conflict markers in the conflicted file directly with a text editor.

```shell title="Usage"
jj resolve [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Only resolve conflicts in these paths. You can use the `--list` argument to find paths to use here

### Options

- `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>`

  Default value: `@`
- `-l`, `--list` — Instead of resolving conflicts, list all the conflicts
- `--tool <NAME>` — Specify 3-way merge tool to be used

  The built-in merge tools `:ours` and `:theirs` can be used to choose side #1 and side #2 of the conflict respectively.
