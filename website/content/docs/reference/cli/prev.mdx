Change the working copy revision relative to the parent revision

The command creates a new empty working copy revision that is the child of
an ancestor `offset` revisions behind the parent of the current working
copy.

For example, when the offset is 1:

```text
D @      D
|/       |
A   =>   A @
|        |/
B        B
```

If `--edit` is passed, the working copy revision is changed to the parent of
the current working copy revision.

```text
D @      D
|/       |
C   =>   @
|        |
B        B
|        |
A        A
```

```shell title="Usage"
jj prev [OPTIONS] [OFFSET]
```

### Arguments

- `<OFFSET>` — How many revisions to move backward. Moves to the parent by default

  Default value: `1`

### Options

- `-e`, `--edit` — Edit the parent directly, instead of moving the working-copy commit

  Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = false`
- `-n`, `--no-edit` — The inverse of `--edit`

  Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = true`
- `--conflict` — Jump to the previous conflicted ancestor
