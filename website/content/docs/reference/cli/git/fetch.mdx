Fetch from a Git remote

If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

```shell title="Usage"
jj git fetch [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `-b`, `--branch <BRANCH>` — Fetch only some of the branches

  By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to expand `*` as a glob, e.g. `--branch 'glob:push-*'`. Other wildcard characters such as `?` are *not* supported. Can be repeated to specify multiple branches.
- `--tracked` — Fetch only tracked bookmarks

  This fetches only bookmarks that are already tracked from the specified remote(s).
- `--remote <REMOTE>` — The remote to fetch from (only named remotes are supported, can be repeated)

  This defaults to the `git.fetch` setting. If that is not configured, and if there are multiple remotes, the remote named "origin" will be used.

  By default, the specified remote names matches exactly. Use a [string pattern], e.g. `--remote 'glob:*'`, to select remotes using patterns.

- `--all-remotes` — Fetch from all remotes
