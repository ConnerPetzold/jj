title: jj git init
isCommand: true

Create a new Git backed repo

```shell title="Usage"
jj git init [OPTIONS] [DESTINATION]
```

### Arguments

- `<DESTINATION>` — The destination directory where the `jj` repo will be created. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

  By default the `git` repo is under `$destination/.jj`

  Default value: `.`

### Options

- `--colocate` — Specifies that the `jj` repo should also be a valid `git` repo, allowing the use of both `jj` and `git` commands in the same directory.

  This is done by placing the backing git repo into a `.git` directory in the root of the `jj` repo along with the `.jj` directory. If the `.git` directory already exists, all the existing commits will be imported.

  This option is mutually exclusive with `--git-repo`.
- `--no-colocate` — Disable colocation of the Jujutsu repo with the git repo
- `--git-repo <GIT_REPO>` — Specifies a path to an **existing** git repository to be used as the backing git repo for the newly created `jj` repo.

  If the specified `--git-repo` path happens to be the same as the `jj` repo path (both .jj and .git directories are in the same working directory), then both `jj` and `git` commands will work on the same repo. This is called a co-located repo.

  This option is mutually exclusive with `--colocate`.
