Push to a Git remote

By default, pushes tracking bookmarks pointing to `remote_bookmarks(remote=<remote>)..@`. Use `--bookmark` to push specific bookmarks. Use `--all` to push all bookmarks. Use `--change` to generate bookmark names based on the change IDs of specific commits.

Unlike in Git, the remote to push to is not derived from the tracked remote bookmarks. Use `--remote` to select the remote Git repository by name. There is no option to push to multiple remotes.

Before the command actually moves, creates, or deletes a remote bookmark, it makes several [safety checks]. If there is a problem, you may need to run `jj git fetch --remote <remote name>` and/or resolve some [bookmark conflicts].

```shell title="Usage"
jj git push [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--remote <REMOTE>` — The remote to push to (only named remotes are supported)

  This defaults to the `git.push` setting. If that is not configured, and if there are multiple remotes, the remote named "origin" will be used.
- `-b`, `--bookmark <BOOKMARK>` — Push only this bookmark, or bookmarks matching a pattern (can be repeated)

  By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

  [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets#string-patterns
- `--all` — Push all bookmarks (including new bookmarks)
- `--tracked` — Push all tracked bookmarks

  This usually means that the bookmark was already pushed to or fetched from the [relevant remote].

  [relevant remote]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks#remotes-and-tracked-bookmarks
- `--deleted` — Push all deleted bookmarks

  Only tracked bookmarks can be successfully deleted on the remote. A warning will be printed if any untracked bookmarks on the remote correspond to missing local bookmarks.
- `-N`, `--allow-new` — Allow pushing new bookmarks

  Newly-created remote bookmarks will be tracked automatically.

  This can also be turned on by the `git.push-new-bookmarks` setting. If it's set to `true`, `--allow-new` is no-op.
- `--allow-empty-description` — Allow pushing commits with empty descriptions
- `--allow-private` — Allow pushing commits that are private

  The set of private commits can be configured by the `git.private-commits` setting. The default is `none()`, meaning all commits are eligible to be pushed.
- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Push bookmarks pointing to these commits (can be repeated)
- `-c`, `--change <REVSETS>` — Push this commit by creating a bookmark (can be repeated)

  The created bookmark will be tracked automatically. Use the `templates.git_push_bookmark` setting to customize the generated bookmark name. The default is `"push-" ++ change_id.short()`.
- `--named <NAME=REVISION>` — Specify a new bookmark name and a revision to push under that name, e.g. '--named myfeature=@'

  Does not require --allow-new.
- `--dry-run` — Only display what will change on the remote
