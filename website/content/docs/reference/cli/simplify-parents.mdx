title: jj simplify-parents
isCommand: true
---

Simplify parent edges for the specified revision(s).

Removes all parents of each of the specified revisions that are also indirect ancestors of the same revisions through other parents. This has no effect on any revision's contents, including the working copy.

In other words, for all (A, B, C) where A has (B, C) as parents and C is an ancestor of B, A will be rewritten to have only B as a parent instead of B+C.

```shell title="Usage"
jj simplify-parents [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `-s`, `--source <REVSETS>` — Simplify specified revision(s) together with their trees of descendants (can be repeated)
- `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Simplify specified revision(s) (can be repeated)

  If both `--source` and `--revisions` are not provided, this defaults to the `revsets.simplify-parents` setting, or `reachable(@, mutable())` if it is not set.
