Touch up the content changes in a revision with a diff editor

With the `-r` option, starts a [diff editor] on the changes in the revision.

With the `--from` and/or `--to` options, starts a [diff editor] comparing the "from" revision to the "to" revision.

[diff editor]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/#editing-diffs

Edit the right side of the diff until it looks the way you want. Once you close the editor, the revision specified with `-r` or `--to` will be updated. Unless `--restore-descendants` is used, descendants will be rebased on top as usual, which may result in conflicts.

See `jj restore` if you want to move entire files from one revision to another. For moving changes between revisions, see `jj squash -i`.

```shell title="Usage"
jj diffedit [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Edit only these paths (unmatched paths will remain unchanged)

### Options

- `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` — The revision to touch up

  Defaults to @ if neither --to nor --from are specified.
- `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Show changes from this revision

  Defaults to @ if --to is specified.
- `-t`, `--to <REVSET>` — Edit changes in this revision

  Defaults to @ if --from is specified.
- `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used
- `--restore-descendants` — Preserve the content (not the diff) when rebasing descendants

  When rebasing a descendant on top of the rewritten revision, its diff compared to its parent(s) is normally preserved, i.e. the same way that descendants are always rebased. This flag makes it so the content/state is preserved instead of preserving the diff.
