title: jj describe
isCommand: true

Update the change description or other metadata [default alias: desc]

Starts an editor to let you edit the description of changes. The editor will be $EDITOR, or `pico` if that's not defined (`Notepad` on Windows).

```shell title="Usage"
jj describe [OPTIONS] [REVSETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<REVSETS>` — The revision(s) whose description to edit (default: @)

### Options

- `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use (don't open editor)

  If multiple revisions are specified, the same description will be used for all of them.
- `--stdin` — Read the change description from stdin

  If multiple revisions are specified, the same description will be used for all of them.
- `--no-edit` — Don't open an editor

  This is mainly useful in combination with e.g. `--reset-author`.
- `--edit` — Open an editor

  Forces an editor to open when using `--stdin` or `--message` to allow the message to be edited afterwards.
- `--reset-author` — Reset the author name, email, and timestamp

  This resets the author name and email to the configured user and sets the author timestamp to the current time.

  You can use it in combination with the JJ_USER and JJ_EMAIL environment variables to set a different author:

  $ JJ_USER='Foo Bar' JJ_EMAIL=foo@bar.com jj describe --reset-author
- `--author <AUTHOR>` — Set author to the provided string

  This changes author name and email while retaining author timestamp for non-discardable commits.
