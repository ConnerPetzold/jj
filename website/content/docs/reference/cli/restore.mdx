Restore paths from another revision

That means that the paths get the same content in the destination (`--to`) as they had in the source (`--from`). This is typically used for undoing changes to some paths in the working copy (`jj restore <paths>`).

If only one of `--from` or `--to` is specified, the other one defaults to the working copy.

When neither `--from` nor `--to` is specified, the command restores into the working copy from its parent(s). `jj restore` without arguments is similar to `jj abandon`, except that it leaves an empty revision with its description and other metadata preserved.

See `jj diffedit` if you'd like to restore portions of files rather than entire files.

```shell title="Usage"
jj restore [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...
```

### Arguments

- `<FILESETS>` — Restore only these paths (instead of all paths)

### Options

- `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Revision to restore from (source)
- `-t`, `--into <REVSET>` [alias: `to`] — Revision to restore into (destination)
- `-c`, `--changes-in <REVSET>` — Undo the changes in a revision as compared to the merge of its parents.

  This undoes the changes that can be seen with `jj diff -r REVSET`. If `REVSET` only has a single parent, this option is equivalent to `jj restore --into REVSET --from REVSET-`.

  The default behavior of `jj restore` is equivalent to `jj restore --changes-in @`.
- `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which parts to restore
- `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
- `--restore-descendants` — Preserve the content (not the diff) when rebasing descendants
